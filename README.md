 Uber Fares Dataset Analysis – Power BI Project

 Project Information
 Project Objective

This project analyzes the Uber Fares Dataset using Python and Power BI.  
The goal is to understand fare patterns, trip behaviors, and time-based trends.

---

 Tools Used

- **Python (Pandas)** – for cleaning and preparing the data  
- **Power BI Desktop** – for creating the dashboard  
- **GitHub** – to share the project



 Steps Followed

1. Data Cleaning (Python)
- Removed missing values
- Removed duplicates
- Converted date/time formats
  
 2. Feature Engineering
- Created columns for hour, day, month, and day of the week
- Marked peak and off-peak times

3. Power BI Dashboard
Imported the cleaned data into Power BI and created:

- **Fare Distribution** – histogram and box plot  
- **Fare vs Distance** – scatter chart  
- **Hourly and Daily Patterns** – line/bar charts  
- **Weekday Rides** – bar chart  
- **Time Series Trend** – fare over time  
- **Map (optional)** – if location data available  
- **KPI Cards** – total rides, average fare, etc.
